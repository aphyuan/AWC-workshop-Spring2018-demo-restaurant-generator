# AWC-workshop-Spring2018-demo-restaurant-generator
### This is a work shop demo for AWC's workshop I host on Feburary 19th.
### ABOUT
* Create a random restaurant generator on a webpage that actually can help you to randomly get a restaurant for you.
* This demo is used for getting start of the project on your own
	* It contains a structured HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file that actually you can make use of. You can use them to create your own generator.
	* It contains two folders for level 1 and level 2. IF you had web development experience before, go for level 2; otherwise, try level 1 first and step into level 2 if you are willing to.
* LEVELs: 
	1. For level 1, you are actually hard coding all the restaurants you like into the program, and then it randomly generates one for you.
	2. For level 2, you are calling Yelp's API, and by entering the zip-code you are currently at, Yelp's API returns a JSON file that contains all the information of the restuarants in this zip-code area. By processing the JSON file, you get all the restaurants and stores them into an array that can be selected randomly.
